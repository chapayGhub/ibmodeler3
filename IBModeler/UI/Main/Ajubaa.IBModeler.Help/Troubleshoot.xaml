                This could partly be because of the number of photos that you provided. 
                The more photos you shoot, better will be the output. Read below for additional things that you can do.

                You can increase or decrease the density level to include finer details of the model. 
                Click on 'Regenerate' button to go to the settings screen. Then move the slider to the right and hit the 'Create Model' button again.

                Remember, that lower mesh density means a lighter model. It will miss finer details. But it will be more responsive to smoothning.

            <Paragraph>
                A higher mesh density model will be heavier but will be more detailed.

                If parts of your model are getting cut out

            <Paragraph>
                Check if your background settings are cutting of parts of the model as well. 
                If you would like to check whether the background is being set properly for all photos, 
                you can see the output of your settings.

                To do that, click on 'Regenerate' button to go to the settings screen. 
                There is a small "Save Processed Images" next to the Create Button. Check it before hitting the Create button. 
                This will save all the modified images to a sub folder inside the folder with the source photos.

                <LineBreak/>
                There is also a "Analyze Cut Out Data" checkbox which also saves images to a sub folder under the parent image folder. It shows the amount of data being lost after each image is processed.

                You can also go back and recheck your markings on the image. 
                One wrong marking can drastically effect the mesh shape.
                Click on 'Regenerate' button to go to the settings screen. 
                Then click on 'Reenger Click Positions'. 
                Then check each photo one by one to ensure the markings are all right.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
                Also, recall if your rotations between each shot was less than the angle between two markings on the disc. 
                This will cause a miscalculation of the angle of rotation for the photos and as a result, the output mesh will be distorted.
            </Paragraph>

            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                Another point to remember during taking the photo shoot is the direction of rotation. 
                You should always rotate in the clockwise direction. This means that if you are looking 
                from the camera at the object, the rotation should always be towards your left.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                <Image Source="pack://application:,,,/Ajubaa.IBModeler.Help;component/images/alway_rotate_towards_left.png"

            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                Lastly, if your camera is too close to the object while shooting, it might result with cut or deformed shapes as well. 
                Try to keep the camera as far as possible and use camera zoom to zoom into the model.

                Click on the 'Add/Change Skin' button. 
                You will be given the option to use 2 photos, 4 photos or 8 photos to create the skin. 
                Try the combination that gives the best results for you. 
                You can also create the skin in one specific color.
