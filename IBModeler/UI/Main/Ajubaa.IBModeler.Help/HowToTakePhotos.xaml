                How to take Photos for IBModeler
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                To  make a 3d model out of an object using IBModeler, you will need to obtain photos of it from all sides. 
                The process of taking the photos is pretty straightforward.

                Disc Shaped Base 
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                The target object should be kept on top of a disc shaped base. You can use anything that has a cylindrical shape like pen holders, containers etc.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
                On the sides of this base, make six or more vertical markings using a marker that could write on your base or you can paste 
                something on the side with the marking. Try to keep the markings uniformly distributed over the perimeter of the disc.

                Place the target object on top of the disc. Now place your camera in front in such a way that the top portion of the disc 
                is also visible along with the object.

            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                Try to keep a good distance between the camera and the object and use zoom to get a closer shot.
                Make sure that both the camera and the model base are levelled horizontally.

                Background Screen
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                Behind the object, you will need to have a red, green or blue background. You can choose any of the three colors as long 
                as the object does not contain the same color. The screen color should be as close to a true red, green or blue
                screen as possible.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                You can use  a sheet of paper, cloth, plastic or even a wall painted with one of these matching colors. 
                A typical green sheet of paper from the stationary shop can do the job. But if you are looking for something more professional,
                google 'chroma key backgrounds'.

                Make sure the setup has adequate lighting. A good daylight around your setup area will work. 
                But if you use lights in your setup, make sure they are pure white lights.

                Rotate And Shoot
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                Now you are ready to take the photos.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                Start with the front of the object. 
                Then rotate the disc slightly by about 5 to 10 degrees and take another photo. 
                Keep rotating and taking photos till the model is rotated by a full 360 degrees. 
                More the number of photos, more accurate will be your 3d copy of the object.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                One important point to remember is that the rotation between each shot should be less than the angle between two markings on the disc. 
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>

            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                The direction of rotation is also important. You should always rotate in the clockwise direction. This means that if you are looking 
                from the camera at the object, the rotation should always be towards your left.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
                Once you have taken the photos, download them onto the computer where ibmodeler is installed. Make sure all the photos are
                in one folder. Also ensure that the folder only has the photos that you just shot. 
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                You are now ready to use ibmodeler to create models from them.
