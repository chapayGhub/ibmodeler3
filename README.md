Software to create 3d models out of photos of real world objects

Users can create a simple setup with a disc shape object like the lid of a jar,
with some markings on it. Then they can place a real world object on it and take
photos of it. They can then upload the photos to their computer and use this software
to make a 3d model out of it with a few clicks. They can then import this 3d model 
to their favorite 3d editing software to create cames or animation movies using them, 
or 3d print them.

The code is in C# and written in earlier versions of visual studio. 
I started it in Visual Studio 8, and later upgraded to visual studio 10.

ibmodeler 2 was the original software that I had written in visual C++. 
I don't own the domains to ibmodeler.com or ajubaa.com (the company under which 
I was selling copies of the software) anymore. But if you google them, you will
still find results. At http://download.cnet.com/IBModeler/3000-6677_4-10633651.html
you will find that it has been downloaded more than 3000 times. The software was also
featured in 3D World Magazine.

I wrote IBModeler 3 in an effort to provide a better UI for the software (its all xaml 
based and pretty looking and much easier to use with just a few button clicks).
It also has some performance improvements. One major issue with ibmodeler2 was that the
3d models created out of it had rough edges. This version solves that problem and gives
the user the option to make the model as smooth as they want. Also, now they can save the
model as xaml in addition to the 3ds format.

The code can be very handy to anyone trying to build a 3d graphics software.
